${the} ${lunatic} on the grass
${the} ${lunatic} on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

${the} ${lunatic} in the ${hall}
${the} lunatics are in my ${hall}
${the} paper holds their folded faces to the floor
${and} every day the ${paperboy} brings more


${and} if the dam breaks open many years too soon
${and} if there is no room upon the hill
${and} if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
${darkSide}

${the} ${lunatic} in my ${head}
${the} ${lunatic} in my ${head}
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
${door}
${and} throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me

${and} if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
${and} if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
${darkSide}
